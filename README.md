# PoCofOneIntent

This repository demonstrates that I expressed a very specific, razor sharp, intent in the introdcutory text of my [DogDispalyOverivew](https://github.com/mittons/DogDisplayOverview?tab=readme-ov-file#introduction), 
or atleast it give a proof of concept, towards the pontential, that i did, have extermely focused, premdidated intent. When I wrote that text.

While the [DogDisplay Overivew Preface](https://github.com/mittons/DogDisplayOverview?tab=readme-ov-file#welcome-to-the-dogdisplayoverview-repository) (which is irrelevant and you can skip to next line if you want) is meant to detail the structure quickly, offering a simple entry point without complexity, giving enough information as quickly for the reader to decide if they want to read further, the clarity and quicknes coming from an express desire to serve the time and need of others.

The [DogDisplay Overview Introduction](https://github.com/mittons/DogDisplayOverview/blob/ae18681446f5a7f31ec3bf0a8b235fa4d3c731bb/README.md#introduction) as commited on `January 13, 2024, 19:03PM`, already expresses some of the intentions of this project.

1.  "this repository serves as an simplified entry point"
  - üö™ An entry point that should, suggested derived/furher clarified documents exist, but abstract the info to words/terms short sentence.
    - ‚öñÔ∏è The entry point should, like any other layer provide only a small increase in the complexity of information, beyond the last (unless explicitly stated), preventing undexpected info overload when a person dives into further definitions. This ensures that if at any point we offer a space that offers too much info overload for a person, more than a person concents to, it will not be to great of a breach of concent, and opting out of reading more of that document should be simple, with minimum effecs.
2. "portfolio consisting of a series of projects that present both:"
    1. üéØ A snapshot of my current active skillset
    2. üîÅ A developing version control history demonstrating my potential capacity for learning and growth over a short period of time.
3. ‚öôÔ∏è‚ûïüå± "This repository as well as the projects should also demonstrate my ability to incrementally leverage the technology, understanding and resources that I have access to, in order to achieve both added value and further potential for growth."
4. üìñ‚úèÔ∏è "Personally, this repository serves as a way to review and document what I have learnt during this time as well as to review and refine my learning processes."
5. ‚ù§Ô∏è "I hope this portfolio also demonstrates my passion for learning, growth and building stuff!"
6. ‚òÄÔ∏è "I also really like transparency!"



## An exmple
### Bash learning curve
The fllowing document demonstrates my bash learning curve [BashLearningCurve](https://github.com/mittons/BashLearningCruve/blob/main/README.md).
```
This files show incremental skill gains with bash beginnin on January 19,
Being more complex on January 29 and
And even more complex on February 11
```
It refers to 4 different files across version history in the the observed project repos, clear timestamping of commits.. all of them a while after I made the statement DogOverivewIntro statemennt: 
  2. "portfolio consisting of a series of projects that present both:"
    3. üîÅ A developing version control history demonstrating my potential capacity for learning and growth over a short period of time.
      - I want to note that I did not what I would learn, but I knew, and was `intent`, that given my constraints.. it would become clear.
        - I knew with `intent` that I would learn something, and that I would be able show case it wihout any doubt if I kept transparent logs, and kept track of what I was learning.
  - 3. ‚öôÔ∏è‚ûïüå± "This repository as well as the projects should also demonstrate my ability to incrementally leverage the technology, understanding and resources that I have access to, in order to achieve both added value and further potential for growth."
        - 
```
 I have created to show a steady increase in bash skill (actually, for transparency I have not aquired those skills yet! 
I can only utilize them as an asset that I understand, but I cant recreate them from memory, nor understanding but 90% of the bash syntax.I do, howeever I understand the operations and can reliably utulize them as an asset)!
<details><summary></summary>

<br>

But will I define the concept of how i do that and provide proof of concept, on how to relaibly, in atleast specific context being able to switch form knowing how to utilize an asset, to being able to ipmlement the asset reliably.
I will use the data generated from the projects for that: Specifically the learning curve.
