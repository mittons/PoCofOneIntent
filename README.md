# PoCofOneIntent

This repository demonstrates that I expressed a very specific, razor sharp, intent in the introdcutory text of my [DogDispalyOverivew](https://github.com/mittons/DogDisplayOverview?tab=readme-ov-file#introduction), 
or atleast it give a proof of concept, towards the pontential, that i did, have extermely focused, premdidated intent. When I wrote that text.

While the [DogDisplay Overivew Preface](https://github.com/mittons/DogDisplayOverview?tab=readme-ov-file#welcome-to-the-dogdisplayoverview-repository) (which is irrelevant and you can skip to next line if you want) is meant to detail the structure quickly, offering a simple entry point without complexity, giving enough information as quickly for the reader to decide if they want to read further, the clarity and quicknes coming from an express desire to serve the time and need of others.

The [DogDisplay Overview Introduction](https://github.com/mittons/DogDisplayOverview/blob/ae18681446f5a7f31ec3bf0a8b235fa4d3c731bb/README.md#introduction) as commited on `January 13, 2024, 19:03PM`, already expresses some of the intentions of this project.

1.  "this repository serves as an simplified entry point"
  - An entry point that should, suggested derived/furher clarified documents exist, but abstract the info to words/terms short sentence.
    - The entroy point should, like any other layer provide only a small increase in the complexity of information, beyond the last (unless explicitly stated), preventing undexpected info overload when a person dives into further definitions. This ensures that if at any point we offer a space that offers too much info overload for a person, more than a person concents to, it will not be to great of a breach of concent, and opting out of reading more of that document should be simple, with minimum effecs.
2. "portfolio consisting of a series of projects that present:"
  a. a snapshot of my current active skillset
  b. "as well as demonstrating my potential capacity for learning and growth over a short period of time.
3. "This repository as well as the projects should also demonstrate my ability to incrementally leverage the technology, understanding and resources that I have access to, in order to achieve both added value and further potential for growth."
4. "Personally, this repository serves as a way to review and document what I have learnt during this time as well as to review and refine my learning processes."
5. "I hope this portfolio also demonstrates my passion for learning, growth and building stuff!"
6. "I also really like transparency!"



## An exmple

### Bash learning curve
The fllowing document demonstrates my bash learning curve [BashLearningCurve](https://github.com/mittons/BashLearningCruve/README.md).



# BashLearningCruve

Lists a few of my bash files (or specific commit changes to them) in the past month or two, in order show showcase my growth and aquired learning with bash.


## My learning curve over time (with references to code and timestamps)

Jan 19, 2024 - [Build script from DogDisplayForC++ project](https://github.com/mittons/DogDisplayForCpp/blob/ac6c71918f26355d47a14db85fbb8d74e8c6c469/build_script.sh)
 - Basic sequence, small.

Jan 29, 2024 - [Build script from DogDisplayForPHP project](https://github.com/mittons/DogDisplayForPhp/blob/master/setup_php/php_setup_script.sh#L50)
  - Much longer than the previous expample, using loops now.
  - The link highlights my bash skills as of Jan 29, 2024, starting from line 51, showcasing [throughly-tested, solid code.](## "Through a hellish experience, debugging my initial approach, figuring out how to build PHP from source over 2 days of hardcore coding.")
  - <ins>Notice</ins>: *This example is* ***actually*** [*broken code (the first 50 are lines wrong!)*](## "In fact the first 50 lines, are not bash script, but the github actions script.. honest im not sure which way I translated it. I definitely made this script in bash first (it was a special hell over 2 days learning to build php from source in a fresh ubunut environment), but the bash code in this file might actually be translation of a GH actions script, that was translated from the original bash code. Anyway. 50 lines of bad code. Bad."), shame on me! Shame! Shame! ðŸ””. Shame! ðŸ””ðŸ””.
  - I figure this code example could also be strong argument for peer review, and code review in general. *(Although, tecnically this "code file" is closer to documenation than code).*

Feb 11, 2024 - [Build script from DogDisplayStaticClient project](https://github.com/mittons/DogDisplayStaticClient/blob/main/deployment_scripts/build_e2e_tests.sh)
 - Move complex, using input args, usage instructions and more complex loops

Feb 11, 2024 - [Process running script from DogDisplayStaticClient project](https://github.com/mittons/DogDisplayStaticClient/blob/main/dev_scripts/run_test_helper_services.sh)
 - Spawning child processes, using signals an traps for cleanup.
