# Definition of the PoC of Intent Of PoC
This repository demonstrates that I expressed a very specific, razor sharp, intent in the introdcutory text of my [DogDispalyOverivew](https://github.com/mittons/DogDisplayOverview?tab=readme-ov-file#introduction), 
or atleast it give a proof of concept, towards the pontential, that i did, have extermely focused, premdidated intent. When I wrote that text.

While the [DogDisplay Overivew Preface](https://github.com/mittons/DogDisplayOverview?tab=readme-ov-file#welcome-to-the-dogdisplayoverview-repository) (which is irrelevant and you can skip to next line if you want) is meant to detail the structure quickly, offering a simple entry point without complexity, giving enough information as quickly for the reader to decide if they want to read further, the clarity and quicknes coming from an express desire to serve the time and need of others.

The [DogDisplay Overview Introduction](https://github.com/mittons/DogDisplayOverview/blob/ae18681446f5a7f31ec3bf0a8b235fa4d3c731bb/README.md#introduction) as commited on `January 13, 2024, 19:03PM`, already expresses some of the intentions of this project.

1.  "this repository serves as an simplified entry point"
  - 🕳️ An entry point that should, suggested derived/furher clarified documents exist, but abstract the info to stort statments with a limited set of words/terms.
    - ⚖️ The entry point should, like any other layer provide only a small increase in the complexity of information, beyond the last (unless explicitly stated), preventing undexpected info overload when a person dives into further definitions. This ensures that if at any point we offer a space that offers too much info overload for a person, more than a person concents to, it will not be to great of a breach of concent, and opting out of reading more of that document should be simple, with minimum effecs.
2. 📚 "portfolio consisting of a series of projects that present both:"
    1. 🎯 A snapshot of my current active skillset
    2. 🔁 A developing version control history demonstrating my potential capacity for learning and growth over a short period of time.
3. ⚙️➕🌱 "This repository as well as the projects should also demonstrate my ability to incrementally leverage the technology, understanding and resources that I have access to, in order to achieve both added value and further potential for growth."
4. 📖✏️ "Personally, this repository serves as a way to review and document what I have learnt during this time as well as to review and refine my learning processes."
5. ❤️ "I hope this portfolio also demonstrates my passion for learning, growth and building stuff!"
6. ☀️ "I also really like transparency!"



## An exmple
### Bash learning curve
The fllowing document demonstrates my bash learning curve [BashLearningCurve](https://github.com/mittons/BashLearningCruve/blob/main/README.md).
```
This files show incremental skill gains with bash beginnin on January 19,
Being more complex on January 29 and
And even more complex on February 11
```
It refers to 4 different files across version history in the the observed project repos, clear timestamping of commits.. all of them a while after I made the statement DogOverivewIntro statemennt:


```
2. 📚 "portfolio consisting of a series of projects that present both:"
  i. 🎯 A snapshot of my current active skillset
```
This one is too vague. The latest version of each code repository gives a snapshot of my current skills in what specific technological I am practicing there. But in other areas, where it is not apparent (nor anything I can prove), some areas I'm just using my active skills to a very basic degree, areas of experties that no one has seen verification off. But its important to note, that I am seeking a career as a software developer, and that is the skillset that should be under focus. In may ways.. I am a beginner here. But with a lot of hidden transferrable knowledge from areas where I have reach further experties.

```
2. 📚 "portfolio consisting of a series of projects that present both:"
  ii. 🔁 A developing version control history demonstrating my potential capacity for learning and growth over a short period of time.
```
- I want to note that I did not know what I would learn, but I knew that I could clarify it, reflect upon it and learn it. Even though I had not explored what I would learn I could define it and abstract terms and seek it with `intent`. (Plus, given that contrtaints/job descriptions have been looking at seem to have a fairly standard set of requirements, it was just a matter of learning it in a strategic way). I knew with I was on the right track, even thoguh I hadnt explored it, and I could act on it `intent`, kwonig that I would be able showcase my learning and growth wihout any doubt if I kept transparent logs what I was learning and logs of my applications of what I was learning, mistakes and successes, the good, the bad, the ugly and the wierd.
```
3. ⚙️➕🌱 "This repository as well as the projects should also demonstrate my ability to incrementally leverage the technology, understanding and resources that I have access to, in order to achieve both added value and further potential for growth."
```
- Feel like I showed demonstrated how I was able to leverage what I had access to in larger amounts, over the course of the timeline presented in [BashLearningCurve](https://github.com/mittons/BashLearningCruve/blob/main/README.md)

```
4. 📖✏️ "Personally, this repository serves as a way to review and document what I have learnt during this time as well as to review and refine my learning processes."
```

I stated my intent, and each key I press, each word, term, phrase, sentence, paragraph that I add only furthers the proof of concoept for this statement. Reflecting on what I have learnt. And reviewing my learning processes. Its both applicable since the intro it self is code, technology, subset of my intent and my learning process.

```
5. ❤️ "I hope this portfolio also demonstrates my passion for learning, growth and building stuff!"
```

If needed, look at the history, and the development beween the linked files in [BashLearningCurve](https://github.com/mittons/BashLearningCruve/blob/main/README.md), it could be.. potentially.. point to a learning curve, growth, and building upon previous knowledge. It's too simple for me to call it a strong argument for my `passion for learning, growth and bulding stuff!`.

```
6. ☀️ "I also really like transparency!"
```

I am publically reviewing and reflecting on my learning process in a very transparent way. Im actively showing transparency towards my stated intent, even enforcing the idea that my intro was not just some text by some person typing stuff (wecause when we dont have the context... its really easy to see text as just text, rather than a precise, meticulous and well-thought out statement of intent, but once we get the context... we might take it more seriously).. and if more people take it seriously, then suddenly I have raised the expecations, the intent stated is my informed choise and design. I like setting expectations towards my stated intent, raising the bar, using my own psycological systems as an accountability tool. Not just here, but anywhere its clear that I am not fooling around, and its clear that im serious (sometimes there is an overlap, sorry). 
  -[Example 1](https://github.com/mittons/DogDisplayStaticClient/blob/main/dev_scripts/run_target_test_servers.sh) Campfire rules. Im not being serious here, but i mean what I say. Its code that will/may already have been depreacted.
  -[Example 2](https://github.com/mittons/DogDisplayForPython/blob/15f83123ad9c123b6b58aad61e9c104c821c63b9/BUILD.md#%EF%B8%8F--23-setting-up-dependencies) - Moving close and closer to the line between utilizing emojis in an effective way, and just making ambominations. (I like stress testing things, as long as no one is affected in a way that affects them negatives,... I learn a lot from exploration).



## Encore

[Lets do an encore:]((## ""Definition of rhe PoC of PoC of Intent of PoC")

```
1. 🐇 "this repository serves as an simplified entry point"
    - 🎩 The entry point should, like any other layer provide only a small increase in the complexity of information, beyond the last (unless explicitly stated), preventing undexpected info overload when a person dives into further definitions. This ensures that if at any point we offer a space that offers too much info overload for a person, more than a person concents to, it will not be to great of a breach of concent, and opting out of reading more of that document should be simple, with minimum effecs.
```
I have gone through the whole intro section in this document. And delved further into each point. By contrast, it becomes apparent that my intention of providing a simple entry point in the public facing intro section, is in fact on point. Any part of the front facing part of the repository should be simplified, reflected upon in further detail an nuance in lower layer sub-documents and/or other repositories, recursively adding the level of detail and, understanding and depth. Givin anyone a chance to opt out before they delve too deep down the rabbit hole. Where things might actually start becoming more wild and unexpected 😼

Being able to reflect, on mutliple levels, is also a part of my active skillset.

3. 🍄🍵 "This repository as well as the projects should also demonstrate my ability to incrementally leverage the technology, understanding and resources that I have access to, in order to achieve both added value and further potential for growth."
```
I have capitlized upon the resources created through multiple commits to show show not just my intent, in learning, and my intent towards continously/consistently (but not constantly) building upon what I have. I have spent time, energy, and effort into gaining access to the level of complexities in bash scripts I used as example in the PoC text in the first section. And gaining understanding of them to properly use them. And I have the capability to [aquire them into my own personal skill set as well](## "Again, will be given a PoC by recounting my experiences of the of dog projects from Dec16-Dec19 at some point")

```
4. 🔍 "Personally, this repository serves as a way to review and document what I have learnt during this time as well as to review and refine my learning processes."
```
What is this, if not reflection and review, on multiple levels? And publicly documented to boot!

```
5. ♥️👑♥️ "I hope this portfolio also demonstrates my passion for learning, growth and building stuff!"
```
I demonstrated growth my bash learning process, showing my capability to build up my skill. And then built upon my stated intent to learn, grow and build stuff, using the domucmentation and version control history I had aquired to verify my that I acted on the intent. On top of this, I am building upon my experimentations, and wierd experimental commits, to give contrast to the parts that were actually refined to a standardized crisp and most definitely, every, single, word was thought out and provided with so much intensity that each word felt like a [shockwave](## "Cryptic foreshawdoing alt text, that will get linked to what future thing it reference, one that is out.")

I have a deep passion for learning, and it requires exploration. Exploration entails mistakes. We can not learn the limits without passing them in some ways. We can only approach it carefully, making sure we learn what we must without human cost, or cost to the environment around us. There is so much potential for that in technology.. and once we get past this infantile phase of humanity. Perhaps we can do exponentailly bigger things, *together*.

```
6. 🕳️ "I also really like transparency!"
```
I am writing my thoughts in clear text! And meta-reflection thoughts as well? Do you want to know more? Find what I have hidden amongst the data! Its not much. Not yet at least. But I do like keeping things out in the open. Without actively restricting anyones choises!
